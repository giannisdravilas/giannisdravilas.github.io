                                <p>The Snow Forecasting Model is an innovative, high-resolution snowfall prediction system developed specifically for Greece.
                                    With a spatial resolution of 400 meters, the model provides detailed and precise snowfall forecasts, covering Greece and 
                                    its neighbouring countries.
                                </p>

                                <p>The model makes use of temperature, humidity, geopotential height (at various levels) and precipitation data from
                                    numerical weather models such as ICON-EU, GFS and GEM. This data is used as input to an algorithm that accounts for snow melting
                                    processes, identifying areas likely to experience snowfall during approaching cold fronts.
                                </p>
                                <p>The key feature of the model is its complex mapping process. Potential snowfall regions are projected onto a high-resolution
                                    topographic grid with a spatial resolution of 400 x 400 meters. This grid consists of approximately 6 million points covering 
                                    Greece and its neighbouring countries. The model's vertical dimension consists of 400 levels (vertical resolution of approximately 
                                    10 meters), so the resulting three-dimensional grid encompasses a total of 2.5 billion points. By repeating the process over multiple 
                                    time steps, a cumulative snowfall map is created, as demonstrated in the examples below.
                                </p>
                                <p>The model's successful operation relies on careful design and implementation, supported by substantial computational resources.
                                    By integrating high-resolution meteorological forecasts with even more detailed topographic data, the system accurately models local 
                                    weather patterns, producing highly reliable results.
                                </p>
                                <p>Since January 2022, the Snow Forecasting Model has been used operationally by
                                    <a href="http://weatherathens.blogspot.gr/" target="_blank">Weatherathens</a>. It's essential to acknowledge that
                                    the model's performance is influenced by various factors, extending beyond its architecture. Temperature and humidity
                                    forecasts at various altitudes in the lower troposphere, as well as precipitation forecasts, as generated by numerical weather
                                    models, play an important role in shaping the results. Additionally, the calculation of the minimum snow-melting altitude,
                                    constrained by the vertical resolution of the initial data and abrupt atmospheric changes, along with the inherent approximations
                                    of the algorithm, significantly contribute to the final outcome.
                                </p>
                                <p>It is important to note that the term “model” in this context differs from its traditional association with numerical weather 
                                    prediction models. Instead, it represents a comprehensive process of assimilating large volumes of forecast data and real-world
                                    data to simulate atmospheric conditions with high precision. The ultimate goal is to make snowfall predictions accessible and 
                                    understandable to the public, translating complex meteorological data into user-friendly, actionable information.
